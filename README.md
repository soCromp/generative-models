# generative-models
Adapted from https://github.com/AntixK/PyTorch-VAE

- *run.py*: Specify the model and hyperparameters, it creates, trains and tests the model.
- *train.py*: Training code (test.py to come next)
- *vae.py*: Specification of the vanilla VAE model (later there will be one file per model, eg gan.py, diffusion_model.py)
